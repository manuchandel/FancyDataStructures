# FancyDataStructures
This repository contains implementation of fancy data structures in JAVA.

A lot of times I got stuck in programming contests due to data structures which are not commonly taught in college curriculum. I decided to learn them and implement them in java to keep a record of things. Also I have started a learning series on Fancy Data Structures on my blog, you can check out posts there, learn and understand them.
